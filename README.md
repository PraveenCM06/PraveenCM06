### Project 1: 
Zeflix -using ReactJS framework
Personal project.
The website is designed using the ReactJS library, offering a dynamic and interactive platform for movie enthusiasts. It incorporates essential features such as props, hooks, conditional rendering, and react routing, providing a seamless user experience. The website showcases a comprehensive list of movies, enabling users to click on a specific movie to view detailed information. The movie details include the poster, cast, rating, synopsis, and a YouTube trailer embedded in an iframe. In addition to browsing movies, users can also contribute to the database by adding new movies. The new movie data is stored on a JSON server, allowing for efficient data management and easy access to updated information. Overall, the website offers an immersive and engaging experience for users to browse and discover movies, as well as participate in contributing to the platform's content.

### Project 2: # React Bus Booking Web Application

This is a web application built with ReactJS that allows users to book bus tickets online, inspired by the popular platform redBus. The application utilizes various React concepts and features to provide a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Key Features
- User Authentication: Users can create an account or log in if they already have one. The application includes form validation to ensure data integrity.
- User Profile: Once logged in, users can view and manage their profile, including personal information and booking history.
- Bus Booking: Users can search for buses by specifying the origin, destination, and date of the journey. The application retrieves and displays relevant bus details from the JSON database.
- Active Bookings: Users can view their active bookings, providing them with easy access to their upcoming trips.
- LocalStorage: User details are securely stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring a persistent login experience until the user chooses to log out.
- **Account Deletion:** Users have the option to permanently delete their account, removing all associated data from the JSON database.

## Technologies Used
The web application is built using the following technologies and concepts:
- ReactJS: The application is developed using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: React Router is utilized for handling navigation and routing within the application, enabling seamless transitions between different views.
- React Hooks: The application leverages various React hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useRef, useParams, and useNavigate, to manage state and perform side effects.
- RESTful APIs: HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE are employed to interact with the JSON databases, enabling data retrieval, creation, modification, and deletion.
- Form Validation: Form validation techniques are implemented to ensure that user input is accurate and complete.
- Public Routing and Protected Routing for data validations.
- Bootstrap: Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, is used to enhance the application's visual design and responsiveness.
